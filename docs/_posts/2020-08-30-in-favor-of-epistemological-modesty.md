Epistemological modesty is a profoundly immodest way of saying “I don’t know as much as I think I know.” It stings a little less when you put it in big words. Just as important as the desire and curiosity to seek out the truth is its counterbalance, the refining process of reigning in conclusions and confidence levels.

**Politics**

There are few things people are more confident in than in their own political views. Some of the political polarity in our society comes from the fact that people’s views are more grounded in their contrast to the opposition than in their personal values. In this way the contra-belief has become a proxy for the “different values” that we previously used to describe political debate.

Take an enduring political question: how much should the U.S. spend on foreign aid? Most people probably already have an opinion (the U.S. spends too much or too little) on this question just from political context. How much do you think the U.S. spends on foreign aid? This question is directly relevant and absolutely integral to forming any opinion about the current state of affairs and yet most people don’t know. Take a guess, here is the answer. And since that website takes too long to interpret, I’ll just let you know it’s about 0.5% of the annual budget. Which is interesting because a lot of people simultaneously think we spend too much on humanitarian efforts abroad and place their ideal % somewhere around 10% (20x more than actual). The point I’m trying to make isn’t that people are bad with numbers and even worse with big numbers. It’s that our intuitions need to be checked. Even though these percentages aren’t being hashed out in popular debate we hold strong ideological differences on a topic like american isolationism without based on party affiliation not on data. A disposition toward epistemological modesty here would help people ask the relevant question and explore the contextual data. In doing this we find similarities in our values, most everyone believes the U.S. should spend some amount of money on foreign aid.

In our current polarized state epistemological modesty might help us some. There are certain topics where tuning our confidence level down a few notches could bring about real dialogue. This is easier for some topics than others when we have the data and it’s easily accessible. The risk of taking this modesty too far is political inertia and nihilism; we can’t do anything because we don’t know anything. Of course there’s a large space in between where we can have political energy and hold beliefs but not pretend to be expert pundits on twitter.

**Science**

No one knows more about what they don’t know than an expert in a scientific field. The irony of this modesty is that in order to make progress in science we need a spirit of unrelenting confidence that may disrupt current paradigms of understanding. Like the guy who abridged his physics Ph.D. and left the field entirely after receiving so much flak for a theory that would eventually become mainstream after he died. As a society it seems safe enough to defer to scientists, but how do scientists proceed if some forms of progress are dependent on a complete paradigm shift? The paradox remains that scientific revolution can simultaneously be a creative act and a destructive one. Scott Sumner an economist offers this:

In macro, it's important for people like me to always search for the truth, and reach conclusions about economic models in a way that is independent of the consensus model. In that way, I play my "worker ant" role of nudging the profession towards a greater truth. But at the same time we need to recognize that there is nothing special about our view. If we are made dictator, we should implement the consensus view of optimal policy, not our own. People have trouble with this, as it implies two levels of belief about what is true. The view from inside our mind, and the view from 20,000 miles out in space, where I see there is no objective reason to favor my view over Krugman's.

**Psychology**

Well even if I don’t really know a lot about the world, at least I know a lot about myself, right? Unfortunately we don’t even have an untainted view of ourselves. Self-serving bias (marking your own homework) is one of the special ingredients that makes us all the protagonist of our own story. Also, we have a whole new field on the science of happiness (okay, maybe it’s just a plethora of TED talks). But we wouldn’t need a TED talk if it was intuitive and everyone knew everything they needed to know to be happy. For example, according to this study, people derive more emotional benefit from spending on others than on themselves even when the prosocial spending doesn’t provide an opportunity to build or strengthen social ties. But we’re not even wrong about what makes us happy, we’re wrong about how we spend our time too. This study using self-reported data found people greatly overestimate how much time they spend on Facebook (interestingly they also greatly underestimate how many times they open Facebook). I’m not sure which of these memory biases is the cause for this social media discrepancy, but it seems that some epistemological modesty is in order for how we see ourselves and our memory. Michael Crichton talks about the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect:

You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray's case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward—reversing cause and effect. I call these the "wet streets cause rain" stories. Paper's full of them. In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.

**Meta**

Epistemological modesty entails being informed about the limits of our own knowledge. On the frontier of science it becomes clear all the things we don’t know. We can ask the right question (how did life evolve from nonliving matter?) about the things we don’t know. But there are some things where we can’t even ask the question because we don’t know what we don’t know e.g. St. Augustine can’t ask about self driving cars because he has no concept of the modern car. Similarly there are risks that are known, even more risks that are unknown but fathomable, and a great expanse of risks that are unknown and unfathomable. These are the unknown unknowns and they should keep us modest too.
