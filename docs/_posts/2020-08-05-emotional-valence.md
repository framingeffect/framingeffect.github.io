We need to continue to reframe our orientation to the world. Just as there are daily tasks that you enjoy more than others, or even the fact that you procrastinate signifies there is some order of problems which you are inclined to address. Ideally these would be ranked straight by their priority, and we usually get this far in our head, but then we convince ourselves to put it off or switch tasks. There are problems that the human brain is naturally better equipped to deal with emotionally than others. Not only that but we have biases and preferences. A conscious effort needs to be made to actively address the issues we are less well adapted to deal with.

Types of problems the brain is ill-equipped to deal with:

* Remote: Too far away (spatially or temporally)
* Gigantic: Too large of a problem, just give up now.  
* Depersonalized: doesn’t affect me
* Abstract: not clear and present

These characteristics are not just a framework for evaluating significant societal problems. They are also present in our daily decision making and moral reasoning. For this reason it’s important to be active in checking our emotional response to different issues.

Significant societal problems sorted by the difficulty for the human brain to appreciate.

* Climate change: 10
* Threat of AI: 6
* Poverty: 2

Whether you agree or disagree that climate change is the most pressing global issue, it is true that it is a problem that our brains are most ill-equipped to handle. And for that I argue it should be given a bump on our dashboard of significant problems.


We are used to ranking issues by sheer priority (values x issue magnitude x issue time sensitivity), and this is what dominates the rational public conversation. We are on a lifelong quest of discerning the issues at hand[^1] that are most important. We will take a couple of them and they will saturate our lives, become part of our passion, our livelihood, our civic engagement, and our public and private discourse. We do well in continuing to learn and search out the problems that are not just close to us but are morally pressing. I am almost certain there will always be an issue out there that is more important to me than the ones I’m currently engaged in. Some issues are more romantic than others. While we think we are ranking issues by sheer priority, our choice of problem is also characterized by its emotional valence. If for every issue we acknowledge the degree to which these 4 characteristics apply to the problem we would be much better at actively addressing issues that may not be getting the attention they deserve.

**To refute everything stated above**: Passion is something that cannot be replaced. It gives not only the activation energy required to start on a problem, but the slow burning wick of energy needed for complex problems. More important than which problem, is how much are you willing to commit to any problem.

[^1]:  *This is precisely the bias I’m trying to avoid. Just because an issue isn’t at hand doesn’t mean it should be necessarily less important.*
